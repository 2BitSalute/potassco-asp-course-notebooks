    "# Problem Description.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of this project is to solve the\n",
    "Japanese grid puzzle [Yosenabe](http://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/yosenabe.html)\n",
    "using ASP.\n",
    "To illustrate the rules of the game, consider a grid as follows:\n",
    "<img width=\"230\" height=\"150\" src=\"img/yosenabe.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Given such a grid, initially without arrows,\n",
    "the task is to move each number surrounded by a frame into one\n",
    "of the gray areas along a straight line, respecting the following conditions:\n",
    "* The straight lines of any two moved numbers \n",
    "  must not cross or meet at any grid cell.\n",
    "* Each gray area must be populated with at least one moved number.\n",
    "* An area may be associated with a positive goal number, shown within it.\n",
    "  If this is the case, then the numbers moved into the area must sum up exactly to the goal number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unique solution of the example, indicated by the arrows of the image,\n",
    "fulfills these conditions:\n",
    "* The straight lines do not cross or meet.\n",
    "* Some number is moved into each of the four gray areas.\n",
    "* The bottom left area is associated with goal number ``6``, \n",
    "  and the numbers ``5`` and ``1``, that add up to ``6``, are moved to it.\n",
    "  The top right area is associated with goal number ``4``, \n",
    "  and exactly number ``4`` is moved to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the displayed solution is unique.\n",
    "One could try to move the two numbers ``2`` into the top right area, but \n",
    "that would leave the bottom right area unoccupied.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number can be moved across an area.\n",
    "For instance, in our example the number ``4`` crosses the area in the middle.\n",
    "On the other hand, you may always assume that the move of a number stops at the first cell (with respect to its direction)\n",
    "of the area to which the number is moved.\n",
    "For instance, number ``1`` is moved to the cell ``(2,1)``, and \n",
    "there would be no solution if we moved it further into the area until the cell ``(1,1)``.\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "That is, regardless of the cell to which number ``5`` is moved,\n",
    "it cannot help to move ``1`` to the cell in the lower left corner\n",
    "as the move enters the same area already before.\n",
    "-->\n",
    "You can play the game [here](http://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Yosenabe/).\n",
    "It is fun and it will help you to get used to the rules."
